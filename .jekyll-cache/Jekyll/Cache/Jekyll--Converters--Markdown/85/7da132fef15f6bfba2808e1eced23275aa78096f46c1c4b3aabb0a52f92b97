I"}<p>Over the last 2 years, I have been working full time/part time on different crypto currency algorithms. It has involved self learning many things finance, mathematics and Computer Science. Recently, I have started having some success with trading algorithms. In this blog, I will write about various observations I have made in my time. I am writing for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I want to know more people and make more friends.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I want to contribute how I can when I can.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
