<p><strong>Summary and Conclusion:</strong>
I applied Price Discovery and Spillover Analysis on BTC/USD data from Bitfinex, Bitmex, Bitstamp, Coinbase, HitBTC, Kraken, Poloniex, Binance, OkEx and CME futures and made the following observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As of May 15, 2020, no single exchange have a extremly dominant role in leading the price. But, Bitmex Perpetual Contracts, CME Futures Contracts and OkEx Spot Market have had strongest role in determining the Bitcoin price in the current run.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today derivative markets play a big role in determining the Bitcoin price. The fall in price conincides with an increase in price discovery role by CME contracts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>During 2017/18, USDT based Bitfinex had the extremly dominant role in starting the pump. But as the price increased, trades on US based exchanges, Coinbase, Bitstamp, Kraken played the more dominat role in leading the price up.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Bitcoin market today is very different than the market in 2017. Traditional financial asset class like Futures contract are having more say in where the market moves. In a sense, against the early anarchy, Bitcoin is more integrated and mainstream to traditional financial ideas.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
