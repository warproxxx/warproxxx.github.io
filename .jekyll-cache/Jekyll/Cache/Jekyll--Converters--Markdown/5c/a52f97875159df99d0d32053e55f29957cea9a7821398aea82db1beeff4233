I"ó<p>Over the last 2 years, I have been working full time/part time on different crypto currency algorithms. It has involved self learning many things finance, mathematics and Computer Science. Recently, I have started having some success in this arena. In this blog, I will write about various observations I have made in my time. I am writing for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Currently, I do not know any people in this space. As my algorithms get better, I want to know more people and make more friends in this space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I have observed a lot of changes in the market from 2015/16 but not much change in your average trader. As I have been a member of various communities these traders belong to and how communities and open source projects/developers have helped me, I feel like I should contribute how I can when I can. This blog is how I am starting.</p>
