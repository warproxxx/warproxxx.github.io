Over the last 2 years, I have been working full time/part time on different crypto currency algorithms. Recently, I have started having some success. 
This success is a report card from the market verifying that I know some stuffs. I am writing in this blog for two reasons:

- I barley know any one in this space. I want to know more people and make more friends.

- I want to contribute how I can to places where I got a lot of my ideas from.  And I like writing.
