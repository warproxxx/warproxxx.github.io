Over the last 2 years, I have been working full time/part time on different crypto currency algorithms. Recently, I have started having some success. 
Now that Market has validated that I know some stuffs, I can now write. My other vested interests to write are:

- I barley know any one in this space. I want to know more people and make more friends.

- I want to contribute to places where I got many of my ideas.
